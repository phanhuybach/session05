        <p class="text"><abbr title=""><b><i>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an 1989) is an American
                        singer-songwriter. Known
                        for
                        her
                        autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading
                        figure
                        in
                        popular
                        music
                        and the subject of widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as Swifties.
                        Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the albums Taylor
                        Swift
                        (2006)
                        and
                        Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with
                        Me" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock on Speak Now
                        (2010) and
                        electronic
                        on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop
                        set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The
                        albums
                        contained
                        the
                        Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together",
                        "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood" and "Look What You Made Me Do".</i></b></abbr>
